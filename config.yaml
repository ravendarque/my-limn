      - type: text
        content: "Most link-in-bio tools are SaaS: you hand over your links, your traffic, and your data. Limn is the opposite: a static page you host yourself. One YAML file, no backend, no build step. You edit the config, deploy it anywhere, and it’s yours."
      - type: text
        content: "Limn is a small vanilla JS engine that reads a single config.yaml and renders a profile page: name, bio, image, and tiles (links, text, images, embeds, calendars). No Node, no bundler, no database. Drop the files on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or any static host. The configurator lets you build a page in the browser and download a ready-to-deploy zip—no YAML knowledge required."
      - type: text
        content: "You own the data. There’s no analytics, no tracking, no upsells. No vendor lock-in. The stack is simple and transparent: YAML, HTML, CSS, and a small JS engine. No third-party scripts beyond optional CDN icons. It’s designed to be auditable and easy to understand. Dependencies and services are chosen with the BDS boycott list in mind—no tools from companies on that list, except where unavoidable (e.g. GitHub for hosting)."
      - type: text
        content: "Link-in-bio pages are useful, but they shouldn’t require giving up control. Limn shows that a useful tool can be minimal, self-hosted, and respectful of the person using it."
